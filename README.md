# Web-Scrapping-For-Infinite-Scrolling-Websites
This repository contains two notebooks:
- One notebook named *Web Scrapping For Infinite Scrolling Websites Using Selenium.ipynb* which provides the web scrapping code I developed for infinite scroll web pages
- Another notebook called *How to choose gifts from Sephora if you know nothing about makeup.ipynb* is a project that applies the web scrapping code to extract product information from Sephora, and finally chooses the best combination of two products for me in a given budget.
